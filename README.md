# Anomaly-based-Intrusion-Detection
From our day Intrusion detection systems based on anomalies is one of the major problem in many fields such as application domain and domain research and even it is  one of  the most important field of research of recent time. It is very difficult to build an intrusion detection system (IDS ) capable of detecting a high intrusion rate with accuracy. We propose to improve this by using machine learning techniques (K-Means clustering of data) that will allow us to improve the detection of high intrusion rate and also a very low false positive while comparing the results obtained to the existing result.
